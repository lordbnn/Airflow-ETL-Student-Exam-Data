## Introduction

This repository showcases the implementation of a data pipeline using Apache Airflow to process student exam scores. The pipeline extracts raw data, applies necessary transformations, and loads the cleaned data into a structured format for further analysis. By leveraging Airflow's powerful scheduling and monitoring capabilities, the pipeline ensures reliability and repeatability of the ETL process.

## Features

- **Robust ETL Workflow**: The pipeline includes well-defined stages for extraction, transformation, and loading, ensuring data quality and consistency.
- **Dynamic Scheduling**: Utilize Airflow's scheduling capabilities to automate the ETL process at specified intervals or triggers.
- **Monitor Progress**: Leverage Airflow's web-based UI to monitor task execution, view logs, and ensure the pipeline's health.
- **Easily Extendable**: Modify and expand the pipeline to accommodate additional subjects, features, or data sources as needed.
- **Documentation**: Detailed documentation provided to guide you through the setup, configuration, and usage of the ETL pipeline.

## Setup

To get started with the Student Exam Data ETL Pipeline, follow the steps outlined in the [Setup Guide](docs/setup.md). You'll need to install Apache Airflow, set up the necessary connections, and configure the DAGs.

## Usage

Once the setup is complete, you can run the ETL pipeline by triggering the DAG using the Airflow web interface.
